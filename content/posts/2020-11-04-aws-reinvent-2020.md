[![AWS re: Invent - A FREE, 3-WEEK VIRTUAL CONFERENCE](/posts/aws-reinvent-2020.jpg#float-right)](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/)

This year's AWS conference, re: Invent, is a fully virtual one. If you never heard of re: Invent, it's the conference where AWS announces what they've been working on, and what the competition has to catch-up with (the list is long).
