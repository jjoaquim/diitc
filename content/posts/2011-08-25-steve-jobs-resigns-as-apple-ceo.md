excerpt: 'It''s all over the intertubes: Steve Jobs resigned from being Apple''s CEO. Tim Cook was nominated as the new CEO may mean that things will continue to run smoothly (I hope). <br /> I do believe he will keep involved in the decision making at Cupertino, ate least for now. Just until the transition is complete. <br /> Will there be any more surprise announcements soon?'

title: Steve Jobs resigns as Apple's CEO

It's all over the intertubes: Steve Jobs resigned from being Apple's CEO. Tim Cook was nominated as the new CEO may mean that things will continue to run smoothly (I hope).
I believe he will keep involved in the decision making at Cupertino, ate least for now. Just until the transition is complete.

Will there be any more surprise announcements soon?
