I've vaguelly <a href="http://designisinthecode.com/2011/07/03/arc-tech-reference.html" title="Automatic Reference Counting">referenced it before</a> (pun intended) and last week <a href="http://www.mikeash.com/" title="mikeash.com: just this guy, you know?">Mike Ash</a> finally talks about it and, as usual, explains it all. If you're interested in learning all about Automatic Reference Counting and how things work behind the curtains, <a href="http://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2011-09-30-automatic-reference-counting.html" title="Friday Q&A 2011-09-30: Automatic Reference Counting">give it a read</a>.
