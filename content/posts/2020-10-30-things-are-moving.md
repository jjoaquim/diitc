For a while, I was trying to get back to publishing some content in this space. As things start to come together on other parts, I finally found some time to overhaul the site. After some changes, I settled with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Pretty fast, simple.

For the theme, I've made some modifications to the [Kiera](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-kiera/) theme by [Daniel Saunders](https://github.com/funkydan2).

As you can easily see, I'll have to check how to display links in excerpts. Soon.
