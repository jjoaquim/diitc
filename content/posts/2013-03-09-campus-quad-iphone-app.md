> We developed a social app for a new startup called Campus Quad that lets students explore what's happening on campus – in real time.

[SoftFaçade](http://softfacade.com) managed not only the create a great looking application[1] but also to create the best Case Study I've ever put my eyes on. Nice pretty animation that result in a timeline of the entire process.
