title: Why You Should Pick Your Own Boss
---

bq. The simple reasons why your boss matters more than you realize are:  
	- A good boss in a mediocre company will protect you and support you on a daily basis.
	- A bad boss in a good company will frustrate and demoralize you on a daily basis.


Great advice for those looking for a job change.
