In a move that has genious written all over [Greenheart Games](http://www.greenheartgames.com) took some measures to try and reduce piracy of their new game, [Game Dev Tycoon](http://www.greenheartgames.com/app/game-dev-tycoon/).

It's a shame that most guys that got the "cracked" version don't get the irony in it.
