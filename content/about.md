Hello, my name is Jos√© Carlos Joaquim.
I'm a Portuguese developer turned manager, working in Paris since 2008.

This is my attempt to keep a consistent writing habit! (clearly failing)

Please note that my views _do not reflect_ those of my past, present, or future employers (a.k.a. what I post is my personal opinion).
